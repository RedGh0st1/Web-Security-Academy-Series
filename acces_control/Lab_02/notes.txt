Lab #2: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable unreleased

Goal:
This lab has an unprotected admin panel. It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application.
Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel, and using it to delete the user carlos.

Solution:
	1.	Analysis with Burp Suite:
	•	I intercepted and inspected the application traffic using Burp Suite.
	•	On the homepage, I identified a JavaScript function in the source code that disclosed the administrator’s login credentials and the hidden admin panel’s path.
	2.	Extracting the Path:
	•	The JavaScript function revealed the admin panel location: /admin-96ryxh.
	3.	Performing the Action:
	•	Using the disclosed credentials, I accessed the admin panel.
	•	To delete the user “carlos,” I sent the following HTTP request:
        GET /admin-96ryxh/delete/carlos HTTP/1.1
        Host: <lab-hostname>



	The request successfully removed the user “carlos.”

 Result:
By leveraging Burp Suite to analyze the JavaScript code and locate the admin panel, I was able to access it and delete the user “carlos,” successfully solving the lab.
